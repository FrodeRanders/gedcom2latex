Excerpts from Wikipedia

GEDCOM uses a lineage-linked data model, with link emphasis on the nuclear family, and the individuals (children) produced by that family.

The FAM record was originally structured to represent families where a male HUSB (husband or father) and female WIFE (wife or mother) produce CHIL (children).

A GEDCOM file consists of a header section, records, and a trailer section.

Within these sections, records represent
  - people (INDI record),
  - families (FAM records),
  - sources of information (SOUR records),
and other miscellaneous records, including notes.

Every line of a GEDCOM file begins with a level number where all top-level records (HEAD, TRLR, SUBN, and each INDI,
FAM, OBJE, NOTE, REPO, SOUR, and SUBM) begin with a line with level 0, while other level numbers are positive integers.
